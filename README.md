# A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms Applied to American Legislature Polarization
Hello, and welcome to the code repository that goes along with our paper [A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms Applied to American Legislature Polarization](https://theburrproject.box.com/s/fr9ba4glk4n0yftgcq2c96mr0ldrpnp0) presented at the IEEE 21st International Conference for Information Reuse and Integration for Data Science (IRI 2020)!

## Getting started
The Jupyter notebook chronologically follows the analytical methods and machine learning models presented in the paper. Weights for the final neural network models are found in the two files with the `.hdf5` extensions. The geographical plots of the final models, as well as other graphics, are found in the `/plots` directory.

## Dependencies
* Keras and TensorFlow 
* NumPy
* Pandas 
* Seaborn 
* MatplotLib
