# A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms Applied to American Legislature Polarization
Hello, and welcome to the code repository that goes along with our paper [A Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms Applied to American Legislature Polarization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fm3mqgcE9eBrPPaTISlfVU8SQnGFZ4b0/view?usp=sharing)!

## Getting started
The Jupyter notebook directly follows the analytical methods and machine learning models as present in the paper. Weights for the final neural network models are found in the two files with the `.hdf5` extensions.
